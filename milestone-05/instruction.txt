Problem Statement

We want to deploy our REST API along with its dependent services. For this, you need to spin up a Vagrant box using Vagrantfile. Treat this vagrant box as your production environment.
Expectations

The following expectations should be met to complete this milestone.

    Vagrant box should be spun up using Vagrantfile.

    For setting up the Vagrant box you need to use the bash script with functions to install the required dependencies.

    You need to use the docker-compose and Makefile to do the deployment.

    The final setup should consist of

        2 API containers

        1 DB container

        1 Nginx container

    The Nginx deployment configuration should be committed in the GitHub repository along with the Nginx config.

    Nginx should be used for load balancing between these two API containers.

    API should be accessible via port 8080 and internally should load balance requests between two API containers.

    You should get status code 200 while making the request using Postman collection for different API endpoints.

    API endpoint  http://<IP>:8080/healthcheck
