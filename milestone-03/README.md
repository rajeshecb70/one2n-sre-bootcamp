## 1. Project Title
  Setup one-click local development setup

## 2. Project Description
  We want to simplify the process of setting up API on the local machine for development. The idea is to enable other team members to run the API and its dependent services with the least amount of steps involved in getting this up and running.

  We wonâ€™t be assuming that other team members have the required tools already installed on their local. So we will be going one step further and providing them with simple bash functions to install the required tools.


## 3. Requirements
    - Python 3.12.3
    - Flask 3.0.3
    - MySQL 8.0
    - pytest 8.3.3
    - Docker 24.0.7

## 4. Setup & configuration
   ```
  # Configuration
